# ML_at_Scale

A quick desciption of the roles found in organization that use AI at Scale

## Roles

There are four roles in Production ML departments:

1. [Business Analyst](#business-analyst)
2. [Data Engineer](#data-engineer)
3. [Data Scientist](#data-scientist)
4. [Production Engineer](#production-engineer)

All of the above roles need some understanding and experience of ML practices.

#### Business Analyst

This role is more of an outward-facing role. It is about re-framing ML
practices into a business framework in terms of business deliverables.

It is probably the least technical role, although technology expertise
still plays a large factor in how valuable this person may be.

#### Data Engineer

This role is largely technical and mainly involves ETL, however data
cleaning and transformation plays a large part. Populating sparse data
may also be a requirement. Database knowledge (both of traditional
relational databases [SQL] as well as NoSQL [CQL, GraphQL] databases)
and expertise is critical for this role.

#### Data Scientist

This is the most purely technical role. Experienced data scientists
are very hard to find and generally have very specific (and deep)
expertise and training. Mathematics, statistics and generally either
R or Python expertise seem to the main requirements for this role.

#### Production Engineer

This role calls for a generalist. Once a ML model is trained, it must
then be deployed in order to become operational (and deliver benefit).

The how and why of this process can be very technical, but generally
will involve a number of separate disciplines - most involving more
traditional IT practices.
